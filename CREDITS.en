Many thanks to the following people (in alphabetical order):

Harald Bögeholz (hwb@heise.de)
   provided a lot of insightful discussions on CD/DVD data
   recovery and Reed-Solomon error correction.
   The "adaptive read strategy" in dvdisaster is based upon his
   suggestions and ideas; he had implemented a similar strategy 
   before and published in issue 16/2005 of the german periodical "c't".

Julian Einwag (julian@einwag.de).
   provides and maintains the Mac OS X / Darwin port.

Igor Gorbounov (igorbounov@topazelectro.ru)
   provides and maintains the Russian translation.

Andrei Grecu (andrei.grecu@aon.at)
   provided an algorithm for recovering defective CD sectors
   from multiple incomplete RAW reading attempts.

Phil Karn 
   wrote an excellent library for creating and decoding Reed-Solomon 
   codes. This project draws a lot of inspiration - and even code - 
   from his library which can be found at http://www.ka9q.net/code/fec/

   Since the code was optimized and trimmed down for dvdisaster´s 
   special needs, you should get the original thing if you're 
   interested in incorporating RS codes into your application.

Daniel Nylander (info@danielnylander.se)
   provides and maintains the Swedish translation.

Andrea Polverini (polve@polve.com) 
   provides and maintains the Italian translation.

Luboš Staněk (lubek@users.sourceforge.net)
   provides and maintains the Czech translation.

Sergey Svishchev (svs@ropnet.ru)
   provided the NetBSD port.

A lot of other people provided additional suggestions and bug reports;
see the CHANGELOG file for details.
